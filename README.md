### Useful resources

- [The Output element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output) - This helped me understand the `<output>` HTML element which is a container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.
- [input type="range"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the `<input>` elements of type range let the user specify a numeric value which must be no less than a given value, and no more than another given value.
- [How TO - Copy Text to Clipboard](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand how to copy text to the clipboard with JavaScript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
